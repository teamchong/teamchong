# Hi there, I'm Steven Chong! 👋

I'm a Software Development Professional who recently relocated to Canada. I am passionate about immersing myself in a new tech scene and continuing to create innovative technologies.

## 💼 What I do

As a hands-on software developer, I specialize in turning ideas into reality and love bringing projects to life.

```typescript
let lifeIsHard = true;
let numberOfTries = 0;

while (lifeIsHard) {
  console.log("Life is hard, but I'm not backing down! 💪");

  if (Math.random() < 0.01) { // 1% chance of turning things around!
    console.log("Nailed it! Overcame the challenge like a boss! 🎉");
    lifeIsHard = false;
    numberOfTries = 0; // resetting the number of tries on success
  } else {
    numberOfTries++;
    console.log(`Stumbled this time, but no worries. I'll rise again! Retry count: ${numberOfTries} 🔄`);
  }

  if (numberOfTries === 10) {
    console.log("Perhaps I need to shift gears. Considering an interstellar getaway! 🛸");
    numberOfTries = 0; // resetting the number of tries after an interstellar adventure
  }
}

console.log("Life is good, and so am I! 😊");
```

## 🌱 Continuous Learning

In the ever-evolving tech world, continuous learning is key. I'm always open to new challenges and ready to learn and adapt to emerging technologies.

## 🎯 2023 Goals
